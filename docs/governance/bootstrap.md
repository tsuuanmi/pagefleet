# Bootstrap another repository from System

The [portable standard](documentation-architecture.md) is self-contained and
product-agnostic. This guide is a bootstrap workflow, not a System runtime
requirement. System's product requirements and proposals are **never** copied
into the target project.

## Create-only scaffold

With Python 3.8+ and a checkout of System available:

    python3 <system-checkout>/tools/bootstrap_docs.py \
      --out <target-repository> --name "My Project"

Existing files are not overwritten. Review printed skipped files and add the
docs router link to an existing root README. The bootstrap copies the portable
standard and checker, writes a **target-local** governance profile, a docs
router, AGENTS.md, a retirement ledger and an initial docs CI workflow.

Then from the target repository run:

    python3 tools/docs.py check
    python3 tools/docs.py sync --check

Only governance/ is created by default. Add requirements/, architecture/,
research/, proposals/, decisions/, engineering/ or other areas **when there is
actual content**, and update the areas and ID prefixes in the target's profile.

## Adaptation rules

1. Update the title, existing source roots, owners and project-specific agent
   invariants. Do not copy System's product decisions or proposals.
2. When there is source, give every configured source package a README and
   declare docs-to-source covers relations.
3. Only accepted requirements and architecture are canonical; put unsettled
   findings under research/ and proposals/.
4. Put the checker in CI and verify its actual conformance level. The bundled
   checker is a **level 1** bootstrap implementation with some extra graph
   checks; it is not a full level 2/3 graph/retirement engine.
5. To upgrade conformance, implement the missing rule catalogue and rerun
   review of all live documentation before increasing level.
6. Once a decision or requirement is accepted, assign stable identifiers;
   never reuse them, including after retirement.

## Standalone adoption

If copying only one file, use
[documentation-architecture.md](documentation-architecture.md) as the complete
normative specification. Its section 9 includes the profile and agent contract,
and section 10 specifies what a new repository must create.
